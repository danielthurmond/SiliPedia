# Early Semiconductor Materials

Before silicon became the dominant material, early electronics relied on **germanium, selenium, and other semiconductors**.

## **Why Did Silicon Replace Germanium?**
- **Better thermal stability** â†’ Germanium devices degraded at high temperatures.
- **More abundant & cheaper** â†’ Silicon is the second most abundant element.
- **Superior oxide layer (SiOâ‚‚)** â†’ Essential for modern transistor design.
